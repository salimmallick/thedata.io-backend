# theData.io Platform Backend

This repository contains the backend services for the theData.io platform, a comprehensive data management and analytics solution.

## Status

ðŸŸ¢ **All backend services are up and running and healthy!**

## Architecture

The platform consists of multiple services working together:

- FastAPI-based REST API
- Multiple specialized databases (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, QuestDB)
- Data pipeline orchestration with Dagster
- Real-time analytics with Materialize
- Message streaming with NATS
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)

For detailed information about each service, please see [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md).
